BLDC motors are integral for high-performance applications requiring efficient, reliable, and durable motorization.

#### Specifications
- **Voltage Rating**: Typically 12V, 24V, or 48V
- **Power Rating**: The power rating of a BLDC motor specifies the maximum power it can handle or deliver. It is usually measured in watts (W) or kilowatts (kW).
- **Speed Range**:: BLDC motors can have different speed ranges depending on the specific model and application. The speed is typically measured in revolutions per minute (RPM) or radians per second (rad/s).
- **Torque**:The torque rating of a BLDC motor indicates the rotational force it can produce. It is often measured in Newton-meters (Nm) or ounce-inches (oz-in). BLDC motors can have a continuous torque rating as well as a peak or stall torque rating.
- **Efficiency**: Notably high compared to other motor types
- **Control Method**: : BLDC motors require electronic commutation to control the energization of the stator coils. Common control methods include trapezoidal commutation and sinusoidal commutation, which affect the motor's performance and smoothness of operation.
