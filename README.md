## About the Project

This project involves the construction of a 3 Degrees of Freedom (3DOF) robotic arm equipped with an electric circular saw as its end effector, designed for cutting applications.

### Features

- **Robotic Arm:** The arm is equipped with multiple joints and links, simulating human arm movements. Servo motors drive these joints, allowing for versatile movement in various directions and orientations.
- **Circular Saw Cutter:** Attached at the end of the robotic arm, this circular saw is powered by an electric motor. It can be programmed to execute precise cutting patterns and paths.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Precision:** Achieves high accuracy in repetitive cuts.
  - **Productivity:** Enhances efficiency by automating cutting tasks.
  - **Safety:** Reduces human errors and fatigue by automating manual cutting tasks.

### Summary

This robotic arm with a circular saw cutter is a powerful tool that offers flexibility and precision, making it suitable for a wide range of industrial applications. It combines the mechanical capabilities of a robotic arm with the cutting efficiency of a circular saw to provide automated cutting solutions.
